Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It is good to be back. As Mitch and Chuck will understand, it is good to be almost home, down the hall. Anyway, thank you all.
Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President. No president has ever said those words from this podium. No president has ever said those words. And it is about time. The first lady, I am her husband. Second gentleman. Chief justice. Members of the United States Congress and the cabinet, distinguished guests. My fellow Americans.
